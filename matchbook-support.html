		<h1>⛳ Matchbook - golf games, made simple</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to our support page. Matchbook is a very small and simple app that keep track of your golf games.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app doesn't connects to the internet, as it stores everything within your phone memory, we don't keep track of any of your personal data either, as we don't register any type of events or analytics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks for using the app!, I hope you'll find it useful.
